# *Lab DC Power Supply*

## *Background*

In order to power my electronics projects in my home lab, I completed a DC power
supply design based on the open hardware uSupply designed by Dave Jones. In a
series of videos posted on the EEVBlog Dave explains the design challenges and
decisions associated with a small variable DC power supply. My personal design
is very similar to the final solution Dave settles on, with only minor
differences. This project therefore represents my first PCB design project with
Altium Designer and as an introduction to opamp feedback topologies

## *Hardware Design*

The regulation topology for this supply is based on the Linear Technologies
[LT3083](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/3083fa.pdf)
linear regulator. An adjustable switching regulator serves as a pre-regulator to
the linear stage. This helps lower the power dissipated in the LT3083 by
lowering the input voltage to a level closer to the desired output, such that
the LT3083 needs only to drop a few volts instead of several when a small output
voltage is desired.

A feedback loop compares the current through a high side shunt resistor to a
12bit set point voltage generated by either PWM or a DAC. As the current limit
is achieved U8B switches Q1, regulating down the set pin of the LT3083.
